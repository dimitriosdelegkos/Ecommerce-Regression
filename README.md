# Customer Expenditure Regression
> Data science project using Linear Regression

## Overview
The **goal** of this project is to find whether an Ecommerce company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website (based on the yearly amount that the customers spend).

The data is from an Ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
